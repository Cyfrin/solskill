# BattleChain Development Standards

Instructions for working with [BattleChain](https://docs.battlechain.com/), from the [Cyfrin security team.](https://www.cyfrin.io/)

## What is BattleChain

BattleChain is a ZKSync-based L2 blockchain that inserts a battle-testing phase between testnet and mainnet: **Dev -> Testnet -> BattleChain -> Mainnet**. Protocols deploy audited contracts with real funds, whitehats legally attack them for bounties under Safe Harbor agreements, and surviving contracts promote to production.

## Full Documentation

For up-to-date contract addresses, function signatures, struct definitions, enums, state transitions, bounty calculation rules, Safe Harbor agreement details, and all other technical reference material, fetch the full docs:

**https://docs.battlechain.com/llms-full.txt**

Always fetch this URL when you need BattleChain technical details. The docs are the single source of truth and stay current as the protocol evolves.
