# Solidity & BattleChain Development Standards

Instructions for writing production grade solidity code and working with BattleChain.

# Installation/Quickstart

Install the Cyfrin marketplace, then the solskill skill.

```bash
# Open a claude code terminal, and in the claude prompt run:
/plugin marketplace add Cyfrin/solskill
/plugin install solskill@Cyfrin/solskill
# Press Ctrl+C then run claude again. Or type /exit to quit first.
/exit
claude --continue
```

# Skills

## Solidity

Production-grade Solidity development standards covering code quality, testing patterns, security practices, and Foundry workflows.

```
Create me an AMM with 2 tokens and a 0.3% fee
Build a token vault contract for a specific token
```

## BattleChain

Comprehensive reference for [BattleChain](https://docs.battlechain.com/) — the pre-mainnet L2 for battle-testing smart contracts with real funds. Covers deploying contracts, creating Safe Harbor agreements, whitehat attack workflows, contract lifecycle management, and all on-chain APIs.

```
Deploy my contract to BattleChain and set up a Safe Harbor agreement
How do I request attack mode for my contract on BattleChain?
Find contracts under attack on BattleChain and check their bounty terms
```
